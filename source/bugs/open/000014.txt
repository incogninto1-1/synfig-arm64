Subject: Convert the Setup Origin or the Animated Origin subparams of a bone can lead a loop

When the Setup Origin or the Animated Origin subparameters of a bone were available they
can potentially converted to be a bone influence type so they can have a bone in the
bone weight pair list. That bone could be linked to the bone itself so it can produce
a loop.
That convert types should not be allowed for the vertex type subparams of the bone
or there must be a checking to prevent that bone sub-subparam being linked to any other bone reference
that has the bone in question as parent or linked.

		Vertex Animated                                   |
		Bone Influence List                               |

 1. make a skeleton
 2. add a bone to it, set the parent to 'none'
 3. convert bone1's origin to bone influence
 4. edit the bone in the bwp to be bone2
 5. export the bwp list
 6. convert bone2's origin to bone influence
 7. connect bone2's origin's bwp list to the exported list
