Subject: Inserted BoneWeight pairs in a Bone influence convert type are not available for other bones

-Create a fresh file.
-Create a skeleton (it provides bone1, bone2, bone3)
-Create a bline.
-Convert one of the vertices parameter to Bone Influience (from now BI). It provides a bone4
inside the first automatically created Bone Weight Pair valuenode (from now BWP).
-Expand the Bone Weight List (BWL) and right click on the first BWP.
-Select Insert Item smart. Do it twice. It creates other two BWPs that provide bone5 and bone6.
-Go to the skeleton and try to find the bone6 or 5 in any of the parent param of any bone. You cannot.
-Go to bone4 from the 1st created BWP and try to select bone5 or bone6 form the Ã rent parameter. You cannot.
-Go to bone5 and select the bone6 form the parent param chooser. You can.
 You should be able to do it for any bone.

It looks like bones 5 and 6 have a different parent canvas than 1 through 4.

It's just another case where the canvas wasn't being set.
