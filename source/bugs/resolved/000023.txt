Subject: origin of a child bone affected badly by Local Length Scale
& Local Width Scale

Open the file: ~/Animaci√≥n/bones/weird-origin.sifz
That file has a skeleton layer, select it
in local mode try to drag the origin of the child bone a long distance.
When the origin duck is released it jumps to other position.
The jump is greater as greater is the duck displacement.
To avoid that effect just restore the Local Length Scale of the parent
bone from 0.470404 to 1.0
When you do that you can drag the origin and it still jumping a little
amount perpendicualar to the parent bone. It is due to the Loacal Width
Scale. If you change it from 0.921387 to 1.0 the problem dissapears
completely.
Those values are discounted (the value is multiplied by) in some way
from the drop position of the duck when the mouse is released.

in my simplified copy ( ~/Desktop/anim/bones/weird-origin.sifz ) drag
the top bone's origin to see the bug.
