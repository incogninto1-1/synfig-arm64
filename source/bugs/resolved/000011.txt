Subject: Edit a parent parameter waypoint doesn't seems to work

Create a skeleton, go to animation mode, modify the parent paramter of a bone.
It creates a waypoint. Expand the bone and right click the waypoint.
It would open a dialog to edit the parent paramter.
The drop down list doesn't seems to work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I right-click a waypoint, I see a menu, not a dialog.  The menu
seems to act as it should.  Did you mean 'menu' where you wrote
'dialog'?  Or did you mean to say that I should click 'Edit' to get
the edit dialog?  And what exactly doesn't work?

(10:54:18) Genete: Create a skeleton, go to animation mode, modify the
		   parent paramter of a bone.   It creates a waypoint
		   (the waypoint is created in the parent parameter of
		   the bone). Expand the bone and right click the
		   waypoint of the parent parameter of the bone. It
		   offers a context menu (Jump to, Delete, Edit,
		   Both, In, Out, etc.). Select Edit context menu
		   entry. It opens a dialog window to edit the
		   parent paramter.  The drop down list (in the dialog
		   window) doesn't seem to work. Try to use the drop
		   down list to select a different parent bone and it
		   remains unchanged

Resolved: it's just a case of putting the currently selected value at
the top of the menu.
