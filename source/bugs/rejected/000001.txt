Subject: crash when duplicating a skeleton layer

If I duplicate a skeleton layer, it appears to work, but crashes when I try to edit it.

I suspect this is a duplicate of bug #2.  If you can reproduce this without deleting a vertex, please note how.
Rejected: The recipe is not reproducible/complete and it maybe a duplicated of any of the others.
